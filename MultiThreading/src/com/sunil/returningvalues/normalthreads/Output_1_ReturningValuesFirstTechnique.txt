/*
* 1st task is 100ms, 2nd task is 1000ms and 3rd task is 500ms
* Here, main thread will first enter wait state for the 1st task.
* After the 1st task is done, the main thread will come out of the wait state 
* and get the result. Then the main thread calls the getter on the 2nd task
* As the 2nd task has a bigger sleep time, it will still be sleeping or executing.
* So, the main thread should enter into wait state for the 2nd task, 
* while for 3rd task it should get the result directly without waiting.
* NOTE: Even though the 3rd task had finished earlier than the 2nd one, its result was still printed last.
* Because, if the main thread gets stuck on waiting for a result for a task, then as per the current code logic, 
* the results from the subsequent tasks also cannot be processed till the time the main thread comes out of its waiting state. 
* In other words, the results are processed only in the sequence in which we have coded to retrieve the results.
*
* What if we want to process the results from the tasks in the sequence in which they are completed
* rather than the sequence in which we are retrieving the results?
