/*
* We got the correct results.
* Check the output carefully, we see that the main thread is put in wait state only
* for the first task and after the first task is done, it wakes up the main thread
* and then the result from the first task is printed by the main thread.
* The result for second and third tasks are also printed out immediately after the first task results.
* What were the second and third tasks are not put into the wait state at all?
* The answer is timing.
* First task sleeps for 2000 ms, while 2nd  sleep for 1000 ms and 3rd tasks sleep for 500ms only.
* So, by the time first task woke up from its sleep, the scond and third tasks had already woken up
* from their sleeps and finished the calculation.
* After finishing their calculations, they had set their done variable to true.
* So, main thread when reaches the stmt where it calls the getter on the second task, it does not go into wait state 
* and get the results immediately. Same for the 3rd task as well.
* Try reducing the sleep time for the first task to 100 ms and see what happens.
